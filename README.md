# Cloud_Computing ( Web application Deployment to Google Cloud)
## 1. Project Overview
For the initial deployment of the web application to Google Cloud, I used Docker and created a Docker container. The Docker container mainly helps to pack up the project code, Dependencies, and configuration from the local machine. By using Docker, the project runs smoothly and performs similarly on the cloud server as on the local machine, without any uncertainty occurring.

After creating a Docker container, I use Kubernetes. This is the main tool for the deployment. Kubernetes mainly provides an API to control how and where those Docker containers will run. It also allows running the Docker containers and workloads to tackle some of the operating complexities when moving to scale the containers and deployed them on the google cloud servers. The deployment covers both local and cloud Kubernetes clusters. 

Finally, with the help of Kubernetes, Successfully deployed the project to the Google Cloud platform.
## 2. System Architecture 
The backbone of the system architecture is the Kubernetes cluster, which deploys the Docker container to Google Cloud. I have used GitHub as a source control repository and Docker Hub as a container repository. First, I pull the git project from the local machine and then create a local Docker image using Docker from the spring boot application. Then push the local docker image (Backend) and docker image (Frontend) to the docker hub and then from the google cloud platform using the Google Kubernetes engine. I can run the docker image as a container in the Kubernetes cluster. The high-level system architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.

## 3.	Deployment
### Docker
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client connects to the Docker host, which can
build, run, and distribute Docker containers. The Docker client and Docker host can run on the
same system. Then it can easily push to the docker hub. Docker is free and open-source
platform for creating, delivering, and operating applications. Docker allows to separate the
application from the infrastructure which allows to manage the infrastructure in the same
manner that I can control the applications. It helps to minimize the time between writing
code and executing it by utilizing Docker's methodology for fast implementation, testing, and
deploying code for the project.

#### Docker Image Create (Backend)
1. First install Docker on the local machine. Open the project folder on the terminal and run the following
commands on the terminal for creating the docker image.
```bash
  mvnw spring-boot:build-image
```
2. After creating the docker image we check the images of our project by running the following
command.
```bash
  docker images
```
3. Now we create a Docker hub account to push the local Docker image into the Docker hub. Login
to the docker hub by providing credentials using the following commands.
```bash
docker login
```
4. Now we need to tag a docker image before we push it into the docker hub. For this, we need the ID
of our docker image give a name and tag it by 5 by using the following command.
```bash
docker tag 4652b5678ce1 tonmoy002/ppmtapi:5
```
5. Now we push our docker image into the docker hub using the tag by the following command.
```bash
docker push tonmoy002/ppmtapi:5
```
6. We can see that our docker image was successfully uploaded to our docker hub account and no
issue occurs.

#### Google Cloud Account
1. Create google cloud account.
2. Created two new projects on Google cloud named PPMT and PPMT-CLIENT
respectively.
3. Created Database instance in PPMT project named ppmtdb and created database name:
ppmt

#### Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a portable and scalable open-source platform which manage the container-based
applications and services. It is a container orchestration system that organizes computer, network,
and storage infrastructure. The master and node components are the most important parts of
Kubernetes. The Kubernetes cluster is controlled and managed by the master node, which also
comprises a set of worker nodes. As the smallest deployable unit on the nodes, the system
orchestrates so-called pods. One or more containers are contained in each pod. The master node's storage and network resources are shared by these containers. Each container has its own set of
instructions about how to execute it. They have a unique IP address that they use to access the
pod. However, each time a pod fails, a new one must be produced, along with a new IP address which is shown in the figure.

#### Kubernetes Implementation
1. We already have the docker image in the docker hub. Now we want to run our application as a
pod in Kubernetes. For this, we first create a dummy project named PPMT on google cloud and
open cloud shell. This cloud shell allows us to create resources and interact using this shell. First
we check the configuration list by using the command.

```bash
gcloud config list

```
 and see we are assigned and we have a project.
 
2. Now we need to set our zone before we create our cluster for Kubernetes. To do that we have
to use the command.

```bash
gcloud config set compute/zone us-centrall-a

```
3. Now we are ready to create our container cluster. For creating the container cluster, we use the command and set the number of nodes is 1. Because our project is small so one node is enough for the project.

```bash
gcloud container clusters my-cluster â€“num-nodes=1

```
4. Now our cluster is ready, and we want to deploy our project to this cluster. We are now
able to get the credentials for interacting with this cluster using kubectl. To do this we use
the command below.

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster

```
5. Now we can use kubeclt and want to create a deployment using the image that we created. For
creating deployment of the web server, we use the following command

```bash
kubectl create deployment web-server --image=docker.io/tonmoy002/ppmtapi:5
```
6. Now we can get the deployment information with the following command:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

7. For checking the pods status we use the following command.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
8.Now we check the spring boot logs status by using the below command.

```bash
kubectl logs web-server-75b8b9d457-spqnt
```
9. After successfully running the application, it will show a status.
