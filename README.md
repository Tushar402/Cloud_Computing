## Deploying Web application to Google Cloud.
For the deployment of our web application to google cloud initially we use Docker and create docker container. The docker container mainly help us to packed up our project code, Dependencies, and configuration from the local machine.  We use docker so that the project runs smoothly and same performance in the cloud server as it is in the local machine and no uncertainty occurs.
